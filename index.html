          <p class="featured-desc">A $75 million documentary following the First Lady in the 20 days before her husband's second inauguration. Featuring cinematography by two-time Oscar nominees Jeff Cronenweth and Dante Spinotti, who reportedly asked to have their names removed from the film.

            <p class="melania-award-desc">Presented by First Lady Melania Trump</p>
            <p class="melania-award-note">Awarded for demonstrating an unwavering commitment to not caring about something while standing directly in front of it. Named after the $39 Zara jacket the First Lady wore to visit detained immigrant children at the Texas border in June 2018. The back of the jacket read, in large white letters, "I REALLY DON'T CARE, DO U?" The White House said it was "just a jacket." The award is the jacket.</p>
            <p class="budget-note">* First Lady Melania Trump earned $28 million from her documentary and launched a cryptocurrency ($MELANIA) the night before the inauguration. This award has no cash prize. I really don't care, do u?</p>

            <p class="nominee-detail">On June 10, 2018, De Niro walked to the microphone at the Tony Awards, paused, and said: "I'm gonna say one thing. Fuck Trump." He pumped both fists. Radio City Music Hall gave him a standing ovation. CBS bleeped the audio.</p>
            <p class="nominee-detail">Two days later, the President of the United States was aboard Air Force One, returning from Singapore, where he had just held a historic summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un to discuss the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. He used the flight to tweet that Robert De Niro is "a very Low IQ individual" who "received to many shots to the head by real boxers in movies." He added: "Wake up Punchy!" He then deleted both tweets to correct the spelling of "too," and reposted them.</p>
            <p class="nominee-detail budget-note">* De Niro won the Academy Award for playing boxer Jake LaMotta in Raging Bull (1980). He and fellow nominee Meryl Streep both appeared in The Deer Hunter (1978). Trump has publicly attacked both of them.</p>

            <p class="nominee-detail">In September 2025, the West Point Association of Graduates cancelled its ceremony honoring Tom Hanks with the Sylvanus Thayer Award, given every year since 1958 to an outstanding citizen exemplifying "Duty, Honor, Country." Previous recipients include Dwight D. Eisenhower and Barack Obama.</p>
            <p class="nominee-detail">Hanks had been selected for his advocacy on behalf of veterans: spokesperson for the National World War II Memorial, national chairperson of the D-Day Museum Capital Campaign, chair of the Elizabeth Dole Foundation's Hidden Heroes campaign. His credits include Saving Private Ryan, Band of Brothers, The Pacific, and Masters of the Air. The association's board chairman said Hanks had "done more for the positive portrayal of the American service member than many other Americans."</p>
            <p class="nominee-detail">"Our great West Point has smartly cancelled the Award Ceremony for actor Tom Hanks. Important move! We don't need destructive, WOKE recipients getting our cherished American Awards!!!" &mdash; President Donald J. Trump</p>
            <p class="nominee-detail budget-note">* The same month, West Point reinstated a portrait of Confederate General Robert E. Lee in its library.</p>

            <p class="nominee-detail">In late 2025, Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene held a news conference in which she threatened to publicly name the abusers in the Jeffrey Epstein client files. President Trump called her. She was in her Capitol Hill office. Everyone in the room could hear him yelling. According to Greene's account, published in the New York Times Magazine, Trump told her: "My friends will get hurt."</p>
            <p class="nominee-detail">Greene pressed him. She urged him to invite Epstein's female victims to the Oval Office. He refused, saying the women had done nothing to merit such an honor. She backed the Epstein Files Transparency Act anyway. It passed the House 427 to 1. Trump gave her a new nickname: "Marjorie Traitor Greene." Someone sent a death threat to her son at college using it. She asked Trump to keep things professional. He told her she had only herself to blame. She resigned from Congress.</p>
            <p class="nominee-detail">The DOJ missed its December 19 deadline to release the files. They are now being released in a staggered formation that will continue into 2026.

Saturday Night Live's Alex Moffat subsequently played Eric for six seasons as a man-child, inspired by a family photograph in which Donald Jr. and Ivanka stare intensely into the camera while Eric is, in the writers' words, "kind of stacked in the back." Eric is Executive Vice President of the Trump Organization, found liable for fraud alongside his father and brother in a $364 million New York civil case.</p>

          <p>The Grammy Awards are the WORST, virtually unwatchable! CBS is lucky not to have this garbage litter their airwaves any longer. The host, Trevor Noah, whoever he may be, is almost as bad as Jimmy Kimmel at the Low Ratings Academy Awards. Noah said, INCORRECTLY about me, that Donald Trump and Bill Clinton spent time on Epstein Island. WRONG!!! I can't speak for Bill, but I have never been to Epstein Island, nor anywhere close, and until tonight's false and defamatory, statement, have never been accused of being there, not even by the Fake News Media. Noah, a total loser, better get his facts straight, and get them straight fast. It looks like I'll be sending my lawyers to sue this poor, pathetic, talentless, dope of a M.C., and suing him for plenty$. Ask Little George Slopadopolus, and others, how that all worked out. Also ask CBS! Get ready Noah, I'm going to have some fun with you! President DJT</p>

      <h2 class="section-title gold-title">THIS PART IS NOT A JOKE</h2>
      <div class="academy-statement">
        <p class="statement-label">This is an unserious website. The following is seriously happening.</p>

        <p class="statement-body">The Trump administration, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and the Department of Homeland Security are carrying out a systematic campaign of mass detention, deportation, and violence against immigrants, asylum seekers, and American citizens on American soil.</p>

        <p class="statement-body">In the past year, ICE agents have shot and killed Ren&eacute;e Good, a 37-year-old mother of three and United States citizen, in the streets of Minneapolis. She had just dropped her six-year-old son off at school. ICU nurse Alex Pretti was pepper-sprayed, restrained, and killed by DHS agents after he tried to protect a woman who had been shoved to the ground. A soccer mom in rural Missouri was detained during a routine appointment and ping-ponged through jails for months, four hours from her home, while her deeply Republican town watched in disbelief. Thirteen people have been shot by federal immigration officers since September. Thirty-two people died in ICE detention in 2025 &mdash; more than the previous four years combined.</p>

        <p class="statement-body">The administration has flown hundreds of people to El Salvador's CECOT mega-prison to be held without charges, without trial, without access to lawyers, in cells holding 100 men on bare metal bunks for 23&frac12; hours a day. A Salvadoran man with legal U.S. status was sent there by "administrative error." The Supreme Court ordered his return. The administration stalled. When 60 Minutes investigated, they found serious criminal charges against roughly a dozen of the 238 deportees. The rest had no charges at all. The President has said he would like to send American citizens there too.</p>

        <p class="statement-body">The U.S. military has conducted at least 35 airstrikes on boats in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific, killing at least 115 people. The administration claims they were drug traffickers carrying fentanyl. Governments and families of the dead say many were fishermen. Experts confirm almost no fentanyl travels by sea. In at least one case, the military conducted a follow-on strike that appeared to kill survivors of the first, in apparent violation of the laws of armed conflict. There was no congressional authorization for any of it.</p>

        <p class="statement-body">At the Dilley Immigration Processing Center in Texas, more than 1,200 people are detained, a third of them children. At least 3,800 children have been booked into ICE detention since January 2025, including 20 infants. A 2-month-old baby. A 5-year-old boy named Liam, detained in his bunny hat and backpack, whose classmates are saving a spot for him at his desk. Five-year-old twins who have been locked inside for eight months with their mother for a crime committed by someone else. Children are hitting themselves in the face. Children are wetting themselves. Children are playing with rocks because there is nothing else. Families report moldy, worm-filled food and undrinkable water. A child with appendicitis was left writhing on the floor and given Tylenol. Staff threaten to separate children from their parents to discipline them.</p>

        <p class="statement-body">From a handwritten letter by Habiba Soliman, age 18, detained at Dilley for eight months with her mother and four siblings, including 5-year-old twins:</p>

        <blockquote class="statement-quote">
          <p>"Why is this happening to us? Why would all of our efforts to achieve our dreams be in vain? Why would the Gov. insist on detaining us with no evidence? Why is it taking so long for the truth to come out?</p>
          <p>"Kids and adults are under great pressure, the detention has to stop before something bad happens. We need everyone to step up and say that detaining families for indefinitely long periods should be illegal. This place could be bearable for 20 days maximum, more than that is really hard.</p>
          <p>"No sane person would ever stay in this detention facility willingly. The conditions here are bad and the rules are made with consideration to the staff's needs not the residents'. All the long lists of harsh rules are taking away the kids' childhoods. The kids are behind in their development, education, and growth.</p>
          <p>"Me and my family dream of the day that we will get out. Ramadan is coming and we will be fasting. I can't even imagine spending it in a detention let alone away from my family. When will our punishment end? When will we be free? No family should ever be separated or have to stay detained for months."</p>
        </blockquote>

        </div>

        <p class="statement-body">Arrests of people with no criminal record have surged 2,450 percent. The number of people in ICE detention reached 66,000 &mdash; the highest ever recorded. To hold more, the administration has begun a $45 billion campaign to buy warehouses across the country and convert them into detention facilities. ICE has identified nearly two dozen sites, many in small towns. A facility planned for El Paso would hold 8,500 people, making it one of the largest jails of any kind in the United States. Apps used to document ICE activity were removed from app stores at the Justice Department's request. Oversight offices have been dismantled. Raids have targeted homes, schools, churches, courthouses, and hospitals. Communities are afraid to send their children to school, go to work, or seek medical care.</p>

        <p class="statement-body">And the administration is threatening to invade Greenland.</p>

        <p class="statement-body statement-blame">We condemn the Republican Party for carrying this out. We condemn the Democratic Party for failing to stop it, for not fixing immigration when they had the power to do so, and for handing their opponents the excuse. We condemn Congress for funding it. We condemn the courts for not doing enough. We condemn the media for covering atrocities like weather. And we condemn ourselves, and everyone else, for not doing more while it was still possible to do something.</p>

        <p class="statement-body">This website has an $11.99 operating budget, three staff members (one of whom is a traffic cone), and a venue between a crematorium and an adult bookstore. We understand this will change nothing.</p>

        <p class="statement-body">We said it anyway.</p>
